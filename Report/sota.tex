\subsection{Examples of Distributed Systems}

A very good example of video streaming application is FreeCast\footnote{http://www.freecast.org/} build in Java programming language and it was released in 2006. Since then more video streaming applications have been created (some of them have been even integrated on torrent systems such as the $\mu$-torrent \footnote{http://www.bittorrent.com/}). A relatively new application as such is the CoolStreaming\footnote{http://www.coolstreaming.us/blog/diretta-tv/} which allows users to view streams of sports. More examples of distributed systems is the banking system or the Bit Coin system. \\


\subsection{Trend and State of the art}

Due to the large scale of such systems the industry as well as the researches move towards standardized methods. A good example of middle-ware used in the industry is the DCE (an early one), COBRA(a modern one) and Jini. Nowadays COBRA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) framework is widely used on the distributed systems domain. Very similar to object-oriented programming (encapsulation and reuse) it allows communication between applications written in different programming languages. \\
