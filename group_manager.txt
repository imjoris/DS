EVERYONE:
  Keeps a map id -> IP of everyone in group
  Keeps a list of everyone who left (can have a TTL)

Group manager through leader election

Before broadcast, register with group manager, he assigns you an ID
Get group manager IP from same person that gives you the list

When you see a vector clock with an entry for an ID you don't know:
  ask group manager
    Group manager responses:
      - Responds with the ID OR
      - Responds ID has left OR
      - Id not in list:
        (might happen just after a leader switch)
        - broadcast request for that ID
        - respond with the ID gotten from the broadcast, if no response to the broadcast, respond ID has left.
