\section{Relation to Distributed Systems}
\label{rtds}

We can define distributed a distributed system as a collection of independent computers that appears to the host user as a single system. We believe that our application meets the above requirements since the host user only sees the streaming that receives while in the background a huge number of different and probably distance machines cooperate to achieve that. Our system is also open, meaning that everyone can join and can immediately start streaming or listen to a stream. Scalability is also an important aspect of a distributed systems. Since such a system is not build around a physical location, such as a server it can scale up efficiently as more and more nodes are added to it. An important benefit of having such a system is that there is no a single point of failure and no bottle-necks are formed between nodes. \\
