Nowadays distributes systems are everywhere and they are widely used for sharing information and data all over the globe. A very good example of such a system is the torrent systems which is a peer-to-peer distribution of data. Our idea was to create such a system that allows users to stream data (e.g. video streaming). We decided to go with this idea since video streaming has been acquiring more user in the past years and creating such a distributed system would be a challenge on its own.\\
